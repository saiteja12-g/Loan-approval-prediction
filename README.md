# Loan-approval-prediction
Loan approval prediction by different machine learning algorithms

We know that loans cannot be given to everyone. A background check of the customer is mandatory. By seeing the customers past and present records, the employee understands
the capability of the customer.

This project aims to determine if a customer is eligible for a loan feeding the algorithm with required inputs.
